					"This addon is intended to make the task of managing DKP easier by automating many of the administrative tasks. The addon makes it easy to both view and make changes to your guild’s DKP. The changes made in game can then be synced with the WebDKP.com website by either using the included sync tool or uploading your log file from the website control center. "..
					"|n|n"..
					"This help document is provided to guide you through the addon’s basic and more advanced use. If this is your very first time using the addon, you can find a handy tutorial on the WebDKP website.  If you have any additional questions not covered in this document, you can also leave a message on the addon forums. "..

					"Most of the features of the addon can be reached by selecting |cFFFF0000DKP Table|r from the main drop down menu (off of the minimap). "..
					"|n|n"..
					"Clicking on this will show the main DKP list on the left and a window with a set of tabs on the right. If this is your first time using the addon the list on the left will probably be empty. That’s because the list is defaulted to only show people who are in your current group. If you were to join a party or a raid you would see the list start to fill in with people. As the table fills in with people you can sort it by clicking on the table headers."..
					"|n|n"..
					"The tabs on the right are where all the functions of the addon are located. This area has 3 main tabs for you to work with: Filters, Award DKP, and Award Item. "..
					"|n|n"..
					"The |cFFFF0000Filters Tab|r allows you to filter what you want to be shown in your DKP table. You can limit the table to certain classes, making it easier to find people you want. Here you also have the option of showing all the people in your table – including those not in your current group – by unchecking ‘Only show players in current group’. "..
					"|n|n"..
					"The |cFFFF0000Award DKP Tab|r allows you to award or subtract DKP from people. Note that this is only used for DKP alone, not for recording items that are awarded. To award DKP all you need to do is select the people that you want to award from the left, enter a reason and # of points to award, then click ‘Award DKP’. To make selecting players from the list easier you’ll find two buttons near the bottom called ‘Select All’ and ‘Deselect All’"..
					"|n|n"..
					"Finally, the |cFFFF0000Award Item Tab|r allows you to award an item to a single player. To use it, select a receiving player from the left, an item cost (in positive #’s), enter in the name of the item, and then select Award Item. If you enable ‘Autofill’ or ‘AutoAward’ (on by default) this information will be entered and recorded for you automatically. If you have these features disabled you can also fill in the item name by shift+clicking on the name of an item in chat.  "..
					"|n|n"..
					"After you have finished recording information in game you can, the |cFFFF0000Sync Data|r from the WebDKP addon to the WebDKP.com site. Checkout the program WebDKP Sync.exe that came with the addon."

					"|n|n"..
					"|cFFFF0000AutoFill|r – When enabled WebDKP will monitor your chat window for any announcements of people receiving items (ex: Zedd received [Crown of Destruction]). When it detects them it will automatically select the receiving player in the table and fill in the item name box on the Award Item tab. If you are using loot tables the system will also attempt to look up the cost of the item in the loot table and fill it in item cost box. "..
					"|n|n"..
					"|cFFFF0000Autofill Threshold|r – Sets the level of item that AutoFill will pick up on. For example, should it only autofill information for Blue items or better or should it also include green items?"..
					"|n|n"..
					"|cFFFF0000AutoAward|r – Takes AutoFill one step farther. When enabled WebDKP will display a popup box whenever it detects an item being received. This popup box will allow you to enter in a DKP cost for the item and automatically record this information in your DKP table. Like AutoFill it is tied in with your loot table. "..
					"|n|n"..
					"|cFFFF0000ZeroSum|r – Checking this enables ZeroSum DKP calculations when awarding DKP. ZeroSum DKP is a system where DKP is only awarded when items are handed out. For the DKP that is spent on the item an equal but opposite amount is awarded and distributed across the entire raid. When enabled, this feature will automatically take care of this calculation for you when you award an item. "..
					"|n|n"..
					"|cFFFF0000Announce Bid in Raid Warning|r – Announces when bidding start via a Raid Warning"..
					"|n|n"..
					"|cFFFF0000Confirm Bid Awards|r – When about to award a winning bidder an item a dialog box will be displayed that allows you to customize what the player is paying for the item"..
					"|n|n"..
					"|cFFFF0000Allow Negative Bids|r – Allows players to bid more money than they have"..
					"|n|n"..
					"|cFFFF0000Used Fixed Bidding|r – Enables a fixed bidding system. In this system players do not bid specific amounts, they simply say whether they need an item or not by whispering !need (the person with the most dkp wins the item). Winning players are than charged an items set cost from the guilds loot table"..

					"Whisper DKP is a feature that allows people to send you whispers to see their current DKP as well as the DKP table. The nice part about this feature is that the incoming and outgoing whispers related to Whisper DKP are hidden from you, so your chat box isn’t filled up. "..

Players in your raid can either say in a whisper / raid / party message how much they want to bid and the addon will pick up this information and display in on screen. Once bidding has ended you can select the winning users and click Award. This will automatically record this information in your DKP table."..
					"|n|n"..
					"To start a bid using the bidding form you can select Bidding from the drop down menu. You can then enter the item name to bid on as well as an optional time in seconds for how long the bid should last. (Entering 0 here means there will be no time limit).
